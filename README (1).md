## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – WEAVE AI MAGIC WITH GROQ**

## 🎯 Objective
Problem Solved:
ANNADATA addresses the critical challenge of food insecurity and agricultural inefficiency by leveraging AI and data-driven insights to optimize farming practices, reduce waste, and improve food distribution. Smallholder farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers often lack access to real-time, actionable data—leading to poor crop yields, resource mismanagement, and supply chain inefficiencies.

Who It Serves:
- > Small & Marginal Farmers (80% of farmers in developing regions)
- > Agri-Cooperatives & FPOs (Farmer Producer Organizations)
->Government & NGOs (For policy planning and food security programs)
->Food Supply Chain Stakeholders (Reducing post-harvest losses)

Real-World Use Case & Value:
->Precision Farming: AI-powered advisories on crop selection, irrigation, and pest control boost yields by ~30% while cutting input costs.
->Market Linkages: Connects farmers directly to buyers via a mobile app, reducing middlemen and increasing profits.
->Food Waste Reduction: Predictive analytics help optimize storage and logistics, saving ~20% of perishable crops spoilage.
->Climate Resilience: Drought/flood alerts and adaptive crop recommendations mitigate climate risks.

Impact:
->Economic: Empowers farmers with higher incomes (+40% avg. ROI).
->Social: Strengthens food security for vulnerable communities.
->Environmental: Promotes sustainable practices (e.g., water/fertilizer optimization).

By bridging the gap between agriculture and technology, ANNADATA turns raw data into "harvest-to-table" resilience. 🌱📊

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:

### Team Members:  
- Name 1: Muskan Raj [ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/muskan-raj-4b936528 ]
- Name 2 : Dinkar Shukla  [ LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinkar-shukla-84696528a/ ]
- Name 3 : Naman Sharan Yadav  [ LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/naman-sharan-yadav-a521b828a/ ]
- Name 4 : Shaurya Mehra [ LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaurya-mehra-309051310 ] 

### Our Approach:  
- Existing tools are fragmented (e.g., weather apps, e-mandis) or inaccessible (expensive IoT sensors). ANNADATA integrates actionable insights into one low-cost, farmer-first platform—bridging the last-mile gap.
- Challenge:
- > No prior experience with Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture—optimized for ultra-low latency but unfamiliar tooling.
- > Limited documentation/tutorials for our use case (agricultural AI).
Solutions:
- > Rapid Prototyping: Used Groq’s quick-start templates to test inference speeds (~300 tokens/sec!) for real-time farmer advisories.
- > Community Support: Joined Groq’s Discord to troubleshoot quantization issues for edge devices.
- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking

## 🏁 Final Words
It was a Roller coaster ride for all four of us. As we were participating for the first time in such a massive HACKATHON, we learned so much of things and come across a lots of problems and debugged it all together. 
We will like to give a big shout out to  Krishna Bahadur ( ours super helpful friend) who helped us in every possible manner.
